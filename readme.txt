How this works:

1. Run "npm install" to install all the dependencies.
2. Write SCSS code in the SCSS folder, import everything to styles.scss
3. Write JS code in the src folder, import everything in index.js

SCRIPTS:
npm run build: Runs webpack, putting everything in the dist folder
npm run start: Hosts the current index in the dist server locally so you can test it
npm run watch: Watches for changes in all relevant webpack files, runs automatically when they change
